### Guide to this Repository

---

**signal_analysis.ipynb**

Jupyter notebook that contains an example of how to find the relative mininums and maximums in a 1-d dataset.

In this case, we generate random data, then use a signal analysis library to find the x values at which

we have mins/max. Check out this file for example code and graphs.

### Mini Git Tutorial

---

**To clone this repository:**

`cd (directory where you want to put this)`

`git clone https://github.com/isaacbautista/devfest2018.git`

**To update your local repository from this remote repository:**

`cd (directory where you cloned this)`

`git pull`

**To push from your local repository to this remote repository:**

`git add -file-' or git add .`

*The second command adds everything in the directory you're in. Useful if adding more than two files.*

`git commit -m "-your message here-"`

*Write a short message about the changes you made. Make it short and meaningful.*

`git push`

**BEFORE YOU PUSH**

You must create a "branch" before commiting and pushing to this repository.

Your branch makes your own copy of the repository and allows you to make changes and do tests

while preserving the "master" branch. Until you're done testing your code, you will be pushing

your code to your own branch.

To create your own branch:

`git branch -name of your banch-`

`git checkout -name of your branch-`

*This command allows you to switch between branches*

To check what branch you are on:

`git status`

To push from your branch:

`git push`

You can see the different branches of the repository on GitHub on the "branches" tab.
